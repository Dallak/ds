## Building a `ggplot2` graph

To build a `ggplot2` graph you need 3 basic pieces of information:

* A **data.frame** with data to be plotted
* The variables (columns of `data.frame`) that will be _mapped_ to different 
**aesthetics** of the graph (e.g. axis, colours, shapes, etc.)
* the **geometry** that will be drawn on the graph (e.g. points, lines, 
boxplots, violinplots, etc.)

This translates into the following basic syntax:

``` r
ggplot(data = <data.frame>, 
       mapping = aes(x = <column of data.frame>, y = <column of data.frame>)) +
   geom_<type of geometry>()
```

As usual when starting an analysis on a new script, let's start by loading the 
packages and reading the data:


~~~
library(tidyverse)

# Read the data, specifying how missing values are encoded
gapminder2010 <- read_csv("data/gapminder2010_socioeconomic.csv", 
                          na = "")
~~~
{: .language-r}

For our first visualisation, let's try to recreate one of the visualisations 
from [Hans Rosling's talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare).
The question we're interested in is: how much separation is there between 
different world regions in terms of family size and life expectancy? 
We will explore this by using a [scatterplot](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/scatter.html)
showing the relationship between `children_per_woman` and `life_expectancy`. 

Let's do it step-by-step to see how `ggplot2` works. 
Start by giving data to `ggplot`:


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder2010)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

That "worked" (as in, we didn't get an error). 
But because we didn't give `ggplot()` any variables to be _mapped_ to _aesthetic_ 
components of the graph, we just got an empty square. 

For **mappping columns to aesthetics**, we use the `aes()` function:


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder2010, 
       mapping = aes(x = children_per_woman, y = life_expectancy))
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

That's better, now we have some axis. Notice how `ggplot()` defines the axis based 
on the range of data given. 
But it's still not a very interesting graph, because we didn't tell what it is we 
want to draw on the graph.

This is done by adding (literally `+`) **geometries** to our graph:


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder2010, 
       mapping = aes(x = children_per_woman, y = life_expectancy)) +
  geom_point()
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Warning: Removed 9 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
~~~
{: .error}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Notice how `geom_point()` noticed there were some missing values in the data, and 
it warns you that they were removed.

### Changing how geometries look like

We can change how geometries look like in several ways, for example their transparency, 
colour, size, shape, etc. 

To know which _aesthetic_ components can be changed in a particular geometry, 
look at its documentation (e.g. `?geom_point`) and look under the "Aesthetics" section 
of the help page. For example, the documentation for `?geom_point` says:

> geom_point() understands the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are in bold):
> - **x**
> - **y**
> - alpha
> - colour
> - fill
> - group
> - shape
> - size
> - stroke

For example, we can change the transparency of the points in our scatterplot using 
`alpha` (`alpha` varies between 0-1 with zero being transparent and 1 being opaque):


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder2010, 
       mapping = aes(x = children_per_woman, y = life_expectancy)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Adding transparency to points is useful when data is very packed, as you can then 
see which areas of the graph are more densely occupied with points.

### Changing aesthetics based on data

In the above exercise we changed the colour of the points by defining it ourselves. 
However, it would be better if we coloured the points based on a variable of interest. 

For example, to explore our question of how different world regions really are, 
we want to colour the countries in our graph accordingly. 

We can do this by passing this information to the `colour` aesthetic _inside_ the 
`aes()` function:


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder2010, 
       mapping = aes(x = children_per_woman, y = life_expectancy, colour = world_region)) +
  geom_point()
~~~
{: .language-r}

### Multiple geometries

Often, we may want to overlay several geometries on top of each other. For example, 
add a [violin plot](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/violin.html) together with 
a boxplot so that we get both representations of the data in a single graph. 

Let's start by making a violin plot:


~~~
# scale the violins by "width" rather than "area", which is the default
ggplot(gapminder2010, aes(x = world_region, y = children_per_woman)) +
  geom_violin(scale = "width")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-13" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-13" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

To layer a boxplot on top of it we "add" (with `+`) another geometry to the graph:


~~~
# Make boxplots thinner so the shape of the violins is visible
ggplot(gapminder2010, aes(x = world_region, y = children_per_woman)) +
  geom_violin(scale = "width") +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-14" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-14" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The order in which you add the geometries defines the order they are "drawn" on the graph. 
For example, try swapping their order and see what happens.

Notice how we've shortened our code by omitting the names of the 
options `data = ` and `mapping = ` inside `ggplot()`. Because the data is always 
the first thing given to `ggplot()` and the mapping is always identified by the 
function `aes()`, this is often written in the more compact form as we just did. 


### Controlling aesthetics in individual geometries

Let's say that, in the graph above, we wanted to colour the violins by world region, 
but keep the boxplots without colour. 

As we've learned, because we want to colour our geometries _based on data_, this goes inside the 
`aes()` part of the graph:


~~~
# use the `fill` aesthetic, which colours the **inside** of the geometry
ggplot(gapminder2010, aes(x = world_region, y = children_per_woman, fill = world_region)) +
  geom_violin(scale = "width") +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-15" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-15" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

OK, this is not what we wanted. Both _geometries_ (boxplots and violins) got coloured. 

It turns out that we can control aesthetics individually in each geometry, 
by puting the `aes()` inside the geometry function itself.
Like this:


~~~
ggplot(gapminder2010, aes(x = world_region, y = children_per_woman)) +
  geom_violin(aes(fill = world_region), scale = "width") +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2)
~~~

## Facets

You can split your plot into multiple panels by using _facetting_. 
There are two types of _facet_ functions:

- `facet_wrap()` arranges a one-dimensional sequence of panels to fit on one page.
- `facet_grid()` allows you to form a matrix of rows and columns of panels.

Both geometries allow to to specify faceting variables specified with `vars()`. 
In general: 

- `facet_wrap(facets = vars(facet_variable))` 
- `facet_grid(rows = vars(row_variable), cols = vars(col_variable))`.

For example, if we want to visualise the scatterplot above split by `income_groups`:


~~~
ggplot(gapminder2010, 
       aes(x = children_per_woman, y = life_expectancy, colour = world_region)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(income_groups))
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-18" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-18" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

If instead we want a _matrix_ of facets to display `income_groups` and `economic_organisation`, 
then we use `facet_grid()`:


~~~
ggplot(gapminder2010, 
       aes(x = children_per_woman, y = life_expectancy, colour = world_region)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(income_groups), cols = vars(economic_organisation))
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-19" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-19" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Finally, with `facet_grid()`, you can organise the panels just by rows or just by columns.
Try running this code yourself:


~~~
# One column, facet by rows
ggplot(gapminder2010, 
       aes(x = children_per_woman, y = life_expectancy, colour = world_region)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(economic_organisation))

# One row, facet by column
ggplot(gapminder2010, 
       aes(x = children_per_woman, y = life_expectancy, colour = world_region)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(economic_organisation))
~~~
{: .language-r}


## Modifying scales

Often you want to change how the scales of your plot are defined. 
In `ggplot2` scales can refer to the `x` and `y` aesthetics, but also to other 
aesthetics such as `colour`, `shape`, `fill`, etc. 

We modify scales using the _scale_ family of functions. 
These functions always follow the following naming convention: `scale_<aesthetic>_<type>`, 
where:

- `<aesthetic>` refers to the aesthetic for that scale function (e.g. `x`, `y`, 
  `colour`, `fill`, `shape`, etc.)
- `<type>` refers to the type of aesthetic (e.g. `discrete`, `continuous`, `manual`)

Let's see some examples.


### Change a numerical axis scale

Taking the graph from the previous exercise we can modify the x and y axis scales, 
for example to emphasise a particular range of the data and define the breaks of 
the axis ticks. 


~~~
# Emphasise countries with 0-3 children and > 70 years life expectancy
ggplot(gapminder2010, 
       aes(x = children_per_woman, y = life_expectancy)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 3), breaks = seq(0, 3, by = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(70, 85))
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-21-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-21" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-21" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

You can also apply transformations to the data. 
For example, consider the distribution of income across countries, represented 
using a [histogram](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/histogram.html):


~~~
ggplot(gapminder2010, aes(x = income_per_person)) +
  geom_histogram()
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
~~~
{: .output}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-22-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-22" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-22" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We can see that this distribution is [highly skewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness), 
with some countries having very large values, while others having very low values. 
One common data transformation to solve this issue is to log-transform our values. 
We can do this within the scale function:


~~~
ggplot(gapminder2010, aes(x = income_per_person)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
~~~
{: .output}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-23-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-23" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-23" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Notice how the interval between the x-axis values is not constant anymore, we go 
from \$1000 to \$10,000 and then to \$100,000. That's because our data is now 
plotted on a log-scale. 

You could transform the data directly in the variable given to x:


~~~
ggplot(gapminder2010, aes(x = log10(income_per_person))) +
  geom_histogram()
~~~
{: .language-r}

This is also fine, but in this case the x-axis scale would show you the log-transformed 
values, rather than the original values. (Try running the code yourself to see the 
difference!)


### Change numerical fill/colour scales

Let's get back to our initial scatterplot and colour the points by income:


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder2010, 
       mapping = aes(x = children_per_woman, y = life_expectancy)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = income_per_person))
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-25-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-25" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-25" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Because `income_per_person` is a continuous variable, _ggplot_ created a _gradient_ 
colour scale. 

We can change the default using `scale_colour_gradient()`, defining two colours 
for the lowest and highest values (and we can also log-transform the data like before):


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder2010, 
       mapping = aes(x = children_per_woman, y = life_expectancy)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = income_per_person)) +
  scale_colour_gradient(low = "steelblue", high = "brown", trans = "log10")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-26-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-26" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-26" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

For continuous colour scales we can use the 
[_viridis_ palette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html), 
which has been developed to be colour-blind friendly and perceptually better:


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder2010, 
       mapping = aes(x = children_per_woman, y = life_expectancy)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = income_per_person)) +
  scale_colour_viridis_c(trans = "log10")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-27-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-27" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-27" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />


### Change a discrete axis scale

Earlier, when we did our boxplot, the x-axis was a categorical variable. 

For categorical axis scales, you can use the `scale_x_discrete()` and `scale_y_discrete()`
functions. For example, to _limit_ which categories are shown and in which order:


~~~
ggplot(gapminder2010, aes(x = world_region, y = children_per_woman)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = economic_organisation)) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("europe_central_asia", "america"))
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-28-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-28" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-28" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />


### Change categorical colour/fill scales

Taking the previous plot, let's change the `fill` scale to define custom colours 
"manually". 


~~~
ggplot(gapminder2010, aes(x = world_region, y = children_per_woman)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = economic_organisation)) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("europe_central_asia", "america")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("g77" = "brown", 
                               "oecd" = "green3",
                               "others" = "magenta"))
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-29-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-29" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-29" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

For colour/fill scales there's a very convenient variant of the `scale` function 
("brewer") that has some pre-defined palettes, including colour-blind friendly 
ones:


~~~
# The "Dark2" palette is colour-blind friendly
ggplot(gapminder2010, aes(x = world_region, y = children_per_woman)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = economic_organisation)) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("europe_central_asia", "america")) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
~~~
{: .language-r}

You can see all the available palettes [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html#fig:brewer). 
Note that some palettes only have a limited number of colours and `ggplot` will 
give a warning if it has fewer colours available than categories in the data.

## Customising your graphs

Every single element of the graph can be modified, althought the syntax can get 
quite complicated. 
We will highlight some common cases in this section.

We also note that you can assign a plot to an object, which sometimes makes it easier 
to modify, because there's less code to type. For example, let's save our scatterplot 
in an object simply called `p`:


~~~
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder2010, 
       mapping = aes(x = children_per_woman, y = life_expectancy)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = world_region)) +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
~~~
{: .language-r}

To view the plot, you can type it's name on the console:


~~~
p
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-35-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-35" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-35" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />


#### Labels

We can change the labels of every aesthetic using the `labs()` function, added on to 
the graph. 

For example:


~~~
p + 
  labs(x = "Fertility Rate", 
       y = "Life Expectancy (years)", 
       colour = "Region",
       tag = "A", 
       title = "Scatterplot", 
       subtitle = "Based on Gapminder data",
       caption = "done with ggplot2 in R")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-36-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-36" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-36" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

**Note:** the `tag` label is particularly useful for numbering panels in composite figures.

### Themes

You can change the overall look of a graph using the `theme_*` family of funtions. 

These are added onto to the graph, for example, let's use `theme_classic()` for a 
cleaner-looking graph:


~~~
p + 
  theme_classic()
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-37-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-37" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-37" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />


### Finer customisation with `theme()`

To tune individual elements of the graph, you can use the generic `theme()` function. 
This allows you to change the look of _every single aspect_ of the graph, so we cannot 
cover it all here. 

But here's some cases that might be useful (try running them yourself!):


~~~
# Change the font size
p + theme(text = element_text(size = 16))

# Remove legend
p + theme(legend.position = "none") # can also use "top", "bottom", "left"

# Change orientation of the x-axis text
p + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
~~~
{: .language-r}

In most cases, the way to figure out how to do these customisations is to do a web search. 
For example searching for "ggplot2 how to change axis text orientation" returns 
[this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13297995/changing-font-size-and-direction-of-axes-text-in-ggplot2) 
as one of the top results. 


## Saving graphs

To save a graph, you can use the `ggsave()` function, which needs two pieces of 
information: 

- The _filename_ where it will save the graph to. The extension of this filename 
will determine the format of the file (e.g. `.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpeg`).
- The _plot_ you want to save. This can either be an object with a ggplot or, if 
not specified, it will be the last plot on your plotting window. 

You can also specify options for the size of the graph and dpi (for PNG  or JPEG). 


~~~
# save the plot stored in our "p" object as a PDF
# it will be 15cm x 7cm (default units is inches)
ggsave(filename = "~/temp/fertility_vs_life_expectancy.pdf",
       plot = p, 
       width = 15, 
       height = 7, 
       units = "cm")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Warning: Removed 9 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
~~~
{: .error}


Another easy way to save your graphs is by using RStudio's interface. From the "Plots" 
panel there is an option to "Export" the graph. However, doing it with code like 
above ensures reproducibility, and will allow you to track which files where generated 
from which script.

> - Look at variation of a variable across categorical groups using _boxplots_ (`geom_boxplot()`), 
> _violin plots_ (`geom_violin()`) or frequency polygons (`geom_freqpoly()`).
> - Look at the correlation between two continuous variables using _scatterplots_
