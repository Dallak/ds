```{r, include=FALSE}
source("../bin/chunk-options.R")
knitr_fig_path("07-")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=12, fig.height=7) 
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
# set ggplot2 theme with bigger text size
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_grey() + theme(text = element_text(size = 16)))
```

In this lesson we're going to learn how to use the `dplyr` package to manipulate columns 
of our data. 

As usual when starting an analysis on a new script, let's start by loading the 
packages and reading the data. In this lesson we're going to use the 
[full dataset](https://github.com/tavareshugo/r-eda-gapminder/raw/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder1960to2010_socioeconomic.csv) 
with data from 1960 to 2010:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# Read the data, specifying how missing values are encoded
gapminder1960to2010 <- read_csv("data/raw/gapminder1960to2010_socioeconomic.csv", 
                                na = "")
```


## Manipulating categorical data

The `stringr` package provides several functions to manipulate _strings_ (i.e. character values). 
The functions from that package start with the word `str_`, so they are easy to identify. 

For example, let's have a look at the distinct values of the `income_groups` variable: 

```{r}
gapminder1960to2010 %>% 
  distinct(income_groups)
```

Let's say we would instead want to have the values "low", "lower middle", "upper middle" 
and "high". With the help of some `str_*()` functions we can do this in two steps:

- _remove_ the string "_income" 
- _replace_ the underscore "_" with a space " "

```{r}
gapminder1960to2010 %>% 
  # remove the word "_income" from the income_groups values; and then...
  mutate(income_groups = str_remove(income_groups, "_income")) %>% 
  # replace the "_" with a hyphen
  mutate(income_groups = str_replace(income_groups, "_", " ")) %>% 
  # check the distinct values for income_groups
  distinct(income_groups)
```

> ## Exercise
> 
> Create a new table called `gapminder_clean`, which fulfils the following requirements:
> 
> - Fix any typos in the `main_religion` values. All values should be in Title Case. 
>   (hint: `str_squish()` and `str_to_title()`)
> - The `world_region` column contains values with a space between words (not "_") and in Title Case. 
>   (hint: `str_to_title()` and `str_replace_all()`)
> - The `income_groups` column contains the categories: "Low", "Lower Middle", "Upper Middle", "High".
>   (hint: `str_remove()`, `str_to_title()` and `str_replace_all()`)
> 
> If you haven't done so already, also make sure that `life_expectancy_female` is 
> numeric (`as.numeric()`) and that `life_expectancy_male` has values "-999" encoded 
> as `NA` (`ifelse()`).
> 
> The final table should contain 9843 observations (rows) and 13 variables (columns), 
> 4 of them character, 1 logical and the rest numeric.

#### Using _factors_ to encode _ordinal_ categorical data

As we discussed in a [previous episode]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/01-objects_functions_vectors.md %}), categorical data come in three flavours: 
nominal, ordinal and binary.

<a href="https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/README.md">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/other-stats-artwork/nominal_ordinal_binary.png" width="500">
</a>

While `character` vectors can be used to encode non-ordered (nominal) categories, 
they are not suitable to encode ordered ones. For this, we need to use **factors**, which 
are a special type of vector that stores categorical data. 

Here is an example using a character vector:

```{r}
mood <- c("unhappy", "awesome", "ok", "awesome", "unhappy")

# convert mood character vector to a factor
factor(mood)
```

Once created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set of values, known as _levels_, 
which correspond to the unique values in the data.  By default, R always sorts levels 
in alphabetical order, like in the example above. 

Sometimes, the order of the levels does not matter, other times you might want
to specify the order because it is meaningful (e.g., "low", "medium", "high"),
it improves your visualization, or it is required by a particular type of
analysis. 

Here is how we would reorder the levels of the `mood` vector:

```{r, results=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
factor(mood, levels = c("unhappy", "ok", "awesome"))
```

The `forcats` package (part of `tidyverse`) provides several other functions to 
manipulate factors. These functions all start with `fct_`, so they are easy to 
identify. Look at the [package documentation](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/) to 
learn more about it.


## Exercise
> 
> Take the following boxplot showing the distribution of income, per income groups:
> 
> ```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
> gapminder_clean %>% 
>   ggplot(aes(income_groups, income_per_person)) +
>   geom_boxplot() +
>   scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10")
> ```
> 
> The ordering of the categories on the x-axis is alphabetical. In this case, 
> it would make sense to change this order, to reflect it's ranking. 
> 
> Use the `factor()` function within `mutate()` to modify the `income_groups` variable 
> to have a more logical order. 
> 
> > ## Answer
> > 
> > We can do this by _mutating_ the variable into a _factor_, where we specify the 
> > levels manually:
> > 
> > ```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
> > gapminder_clean %>% 
> >   # convert income groups to a factor
> >   mutate(income_groups = factor(income_groups, 
> >                                 levels = c("Low", 
> >                                            "Lower Middle", 
> >                                            "Upper Middle",
> >                                            "High"))) %>% 
> >   # make the graph
> >   ggplot(aes(income_groups, income_per_person)) +
> >   geom_boxplot() +
> >   scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10")

## Saving data

Now that we have a clean version of our table, it's a good idea to save it for 
future use. You can use the `write_*()` family of functions to save data in a variety 
of formats. 

Let's use `write_csv()` as an example. 
The `write_csv()` function needs the name of the table you want to save and then 
_path_ to the file you want to save it in (don't forget the file extension!):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write_csv(gapminder_clean, "data/processed/gapminder1960to2010_clean.csv")
```

There are many other functions for saving data, you can check the documentation 
with `?write_delim`.
