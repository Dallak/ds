## Checklist for getting started with your project

- Create a directory for your project
- Create a few sub-directories such as `scripts` and `data`
- Create a new "R Project" `File` > `New Project...`

Don't forget to save your scripts often (sometimes RStudio may crash).



```{r}
# test reading some data
gapminder2010 <- read_csv("./data/gapminder2010_socioeconomic.csv",
                          na = "",
                          col_types = cols())
```


```{r}
# test a graph
gapminder2010 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(income_per_person, child_mortality)) +
  geom_point()
```
